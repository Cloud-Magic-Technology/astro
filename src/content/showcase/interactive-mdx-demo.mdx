# Interactive MDX Content

MDX lets you use JSX components directly in your Markdown content. This means you can create rich, interactive documentation and blog posts.

## Embedded React Component

Here's a fully interactive React component embedded in this MDX file:

<InteractiveCounter client:visible initialValue={10} step={5} label="Step Counter" />

The component above is hydrated when it scrolls into view (`client:visible`), demonstrating Astro's partial hydration in MDX content.

## Custom Callout Components

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  MDX components can be Astro components too! This callout is a static Astro component
  that ships zero JavaScript.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Remember that interactive components need a `client:` directive to hydrate.
  Without it, they render as static HTML.
</Callout>

<Callout type="note" title="Did you know?">
  Astro's MDX integration automatically handles imports and component rendering.
  Just import your components and use them like HTML tags.
</Callout>

## Code with Explanation

You can mix code blocks with interactive examples:

```tsx
// This is the component used above
export default function InteractiveCounter({ step = 1 }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + step)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Try changing the step value in the component above to see how props work!

## Another Interactive Example

<InteractiveCounter client:load initialValue={0} step={1} label="Basic Counter" />

This counter uses `client:load` to hydrate immediately when the page loads.

## Benefits of MDX

1. **Write content naturally** - Use Markdown for prose
2. **Add interactivity** - Embed framework components where needed
3. **Reuse components** - Same components work in pages and content
4. **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support for component props
5. **Content collections** - Organize and query your MDX content
